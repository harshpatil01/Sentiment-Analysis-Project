📝 Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews Using NLP & Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze and classify customer reviews as Positive or Negative. The dataset contains over 568,454 Amazon reviews. We compare multiple ML models to find the best-performing one and deploy the final model as a Streamlit Web Application.

📂 Dataset Overview

Dataset: Amazon Customer Reviews (🚨 Dataset is too large for GitHub, download from Google Drive)

🔹 Features:

Feature	Description
Id	Unique identifier for each review
ProductId	Unique identifier for the product
UserId	Unique identifier for the reviewer
ProfileName	Name of the reviewer
HelpfulnessNumerator	Number of helpful votes
HelpfulnessDenominator	Total votes for helpfulness
Score	Rating (1 to 5)
Summary	Short review title
Text	Full review content

🔹 Sentiment Labels:
	•	Positive (Score > 3)
	•	Negative (Score ≤ 3)

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔹 Steps Performed:

✅ Checking for missing values
✅ Analyzing sentiment distribution
✅ Finding the most commonly used words

📈 Visuals & Code

1️⃣ Distribution of Review Scores

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.countplot(x=df['Score'], palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Distribution of Review Scores")
plt.xlabel("Score (1-5)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()

📌 Insight: More positive reviews than negative ones.

2️⃣ Most Frequent Words in Reviews

from wordcloud import WordCloud

text = " ".join(review for review in df['Text'])
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color="white").generate(text)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation="bilinear")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

📌 Insight: Common words include “good”, “great”, “love”, “bad”, “terrible”.

🛠 Data Preprocessing

🔹 Steps Taken:

✅ Removing Stopwords & Punctuation
✅ Tokenization & Lemmatization
✅ TF-IDF Vectorization for Feature Extraction
✅ Convert Scores into Binary Sentiment Labels

🔹 Converting Scores into Sentiment Labels

df["Sentiment"] = df["Score"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 3 else 0)  # 4-5 → Positive, 1-2 → Negative

🔹 TF-IDF Vectorization

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)  # Keep top 5000 words
X_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(df["Text"])

🤖 Machine Learning Models

🔹 Implemented Models:

✅ Logistic Regression
✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
✅ Decision Tree Classifier
✅ Random Forest Classifier
✅ XGBoost
✅ Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

🔹 Training Models

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import xgboost as xgb

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_tfidf, df["Sentiment"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

models = {
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(),
    "SVM": SVC(kernel="linear"),
    "Decision Tree": DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    "XGBoost": xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric="logloss"),
    "SGD Classifier": SGDClassifier(loss="hinge"),
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

📊 Model Evaluation & Results

🔹 Performance Comparison

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
Logistic Regression	85%	84%	85%	85%
SVM	88%	87%	88%	88%
Random Forest	87%	86%	87%	87%
XGBoost	90%	89%	90%	90%
Decision Tree	82%	80%	82%	81%

🔹 Confusion Matrices

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

def plot_conf_matrix(y_true, y_pred, model_name):
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues", xticklabels=['Negative', 'Positive'], yticklabels=['Negative', 'Positive'])
    plt.title(f"Confusion Matrix - {model_name}")
    plt.xlabel("Predicted")
    plt.ylabel("Actual")
    plt.show()

📌 Visualizing confusion matrices for each model.
